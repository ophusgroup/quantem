    Direct ptychography in the scan-space Fourier domain.

    Every kernel here -- SSB, OBF, matched-filter, iCoM and parallax -- is a multiplier on
    ``G(k, q)``, the virtual bright-field stack Fourier transformed over the scan. The
    object is recovered by summing those multipliers over bright-field pixels and
    transforming back once.

    Because the multiplication happens in ``q``, the scan has to lie on a regular grid.
    :meth:`from_dataset4d` and :meth:`from_virtual_bfs` are given one; :meth:`from_dataset3d`
    resamples ungridded positions onto one, which is where its caveats come from.

    The alternative is
    :class:`~quantem.diffractive_imaging.direct_ptychography_montage.DirectPtychographyMontage`,
    which accumulates the scan onto a real-space canvas and needs no grid. See its class
    docstring for the full comparison; in short, this class is exact and cheapest on a
    gridded scan, but a bright-field mask beyond a few tens of thousands of pixels will not
    fit in memory here.

        Build from an ungridded stack of diffraction patterns and their probe positions.

        Every kernel here is a multiplier on the scan-space Fourier transform, which needs a
        regular grid. So the bright-field images are resampled onto one first, by splatting
        them at their probe positions with no aberration shift and dividing by the
        accumulated weight. Once gridded, SSB, OBF, matched-filter and iCoM all run exactly
        as they do for a raster scan.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset : Dataset3d
            ``(N, Qx, Qy)`` diffraction patterns, reciprocal units ``"A^-1"`` or ``"mrad"``.
        positions : Dataset2d, torch.Tensor or ndarray
            ``(N, 2)`` probe positions in Angstrom, ordered ``(row, col)`` to match the
            diffraction axes. A ``Dataset2d`` must carry units ``"A"``.
        rotation_angle : float
            Detector rotation in degrees. Required: rotation is otherwise estimated from the
            curl of the center of mass over a 2D scan grid, which an ungridded scan lacks.
        scan_sampling : tuple of float or "auto"
            Grid pixel size in Angstrom. ``"auto"`` uses the median nearest-neighbour
            position spacing and warns with the inferred value.

            This, rather than ``reconstruct(upsampling_factor=...)``, is how to sample more
            finely than the scan. Pass a fraction of the position spacing and the empty
            pixels in between become the sparse comb the deconvolution unfolds, with its
            teeth on the real probe positions. Measured against the analytical parallax CTF
            on a scan scattered by a full pixel, correlation over the band above the scan
            Nyquist: 0.720 for binning then ``upsampling_factor=2``, against 0.997 for
            halving ``scan_sampling`` instead, and 0.982 for the montage.
        scan_gpts : tuple of int, optional
            Grid size. Defaults to whatever just covers the positions at ``scan_sampling``,
            and may only be larger than that -- ``scan_sampling`` stays authoritative, so
            this pads the canvas rather than rescaling the positions into it.
        interpolation : {"nearest", "bilinear"}
            Deposition scheme, matching ``DirectPtychographyMontage.reconstruct``.
            ``"nearest"`` by default; see :func:`regrid_vbf_stack`.
        hole_fill : {"mean", "zero"}
            What to put in grid pixels no probe position reached. Defaults to each
            bright-field image's mean over the visited pixels, which matters on a masked or
            irregular scan and is also what centers a comb's gaps -- see
            :func:`regrid_vbf_stack`.

        Notes
        -----
        Regridding has two failure modes, both of which raise a warning.

        Avoid combining this with ``reconstruct(upsampling_factor > 1)`` on an irregular
        scan; pass a finer ``scan_sampling`` instead. Upsampling at reconstruct time recovers
        detail above the scan Nyquist from where each probe sat, which binning onto a grid
        discards, so the extra band returns as a replica of the contrast-transfer function
        rather than an extension of it. With no holes, correlation over the extension band
        falls 0.997 -> 0.822 -> 0.711 as the sub-pixel scatter grows from 0 to 0.5 to 1.0
        grid pixels.

        The second is holes: a grid pixel no probe reached has to be invented. ``hole_fill``
        keeps that from becoming a hard-edged step, but a large filled region still biases
        the result, and a coarser ``scan_gpts`` is the usual fix. Contiguous holes are worse
        than scattered ones at equal fraction -- scattered holes behave like noise, while an
        excluded region is a low-frequency mask the deconvolution spreads everywhere. Note
        that a masked scan and an upsampled one want opposite treatments, filled holes versus
        deliberate gaps, and ``hole_fill`` cannot do both at once.

        Both are properties of the regridding rather than the deconvolution, so neither
        applies to
        :class:`~quantem.diffractive_imaging.direct_ptychography_montage.DirectPtychographyMontage`,
        which uses the positions as measured. Prefer it for a scan that is sparse, strongly
        irregular, or both masked and upsampled; see its class docstring for the comparison.
